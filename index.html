   <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) (also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons) is a men's Twenty20 (T20) cricket league that is annually held in India and contested by ten city-based franchise teams.[3][4]<br> The BCCI founded the league in 2007. The competition is usually held in summer between March and May every year.<br> It has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme due to fewer international cricket tours happening during IPL seasons worldwide.[5]
   The IPL is the most-popular cricket league in the world; in 2014, it was ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues.[6] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[7][8] The brand value of the IPL in 2022 was ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion).[9] According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to the GDP of the economy of India.[10] In December 2022, the IPL became a decacorn valued at US$10.9 billion, registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a report by consulting firm D & P Advisory.[11] Its 2023 final was the most streamed live event on internet with 3.2 Cr viewers.[12]
    In 2023 the league sold its media rights for the period of 2023–2027 for $6.4 billion to Viacom18 and Star Sports,[13] making the IPL's value per match $13.4 million.[14] As of 2023, there have been sixteen seasons of the tournament. The present title holders are Chennai Super Kings, who won the IPL 2023 by defeating Gujarat Titans in the final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahemedabad.The Indian Cricket League (ICL) was founded in 2007 with funding provided by Zee Entertainment Enterprises.[15] The ICL was not recognised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the BCCI was not pleased with its committee members joining the ICL executive board.[16] To prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI increased the prize money in its domestic tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players joining the ICL, which the BCCI considered a rebel league.[17][18]

Foundation
On 13 September 2007,[19] following India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup,[20] the BCCI announced a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket (T20) competition called Indian Premier League. The first season was due to start in April 2008 in a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the IPL effort, gave details of the tournament, including its format, prize money, franchise revenue system, and squad composition rules. It was also announced the IPL would be run by a seven-man governing council composed of former India players and BCCI officials and that the two top IPL teams would qualify for that year's Champions League Twenty20. Modi also said the BCCI had been working on the idea for two years and that the IPL was not started as a "knee-jerk reaction" to the ICL.[19] The league's format was similar to that of the English Premier League and the National Basketball Association in the United States.[18] According to Modi: "The IPL has been designed to entice an entirely new generation of sports fans into the grounds throughout the country. The dynamic Twenty20 format has been designed to attract a young fan base, including women and children."[19]

To choose team owners for the new league, an auction of franchises was held on 24 January 2008; the reserve prices of the franchises were around $400 million.[18] At the end of the auction, the winning bidders and the cities in which the teams would be based: Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Mohali, and Mumbai.[18] The franchises were sold for a total of $723.59 million.[21] The ICL ended in 2008.[22]

Pakistani players have not been allowed to take part in the IPL following the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks due to Pakistan's involvement in the attacks, which angered many Indians.[23][24][25][26][excessive citations]

Expansions and terminations

On 21 March 2010, new franchises Pune Warriors India and Kochi Tuskers Kerala joined the league before the fourth season in 2011.[27] Sahara Adventure Sports Group bought the Pune franchise for $370 million while Rendezvous Sports World bought the Kochi franchise for $333.3 million.[27] On 11 November 2011, Kochi Tuskers Kerala were terminated when they failed to pay the BCCI the 10% bank guarantee element of the franchise before the 2011 season began.[28]

On 14 September 2012, after the 2009 champion team, the Deccan Chargers could not find new owners, the BCCI announced the team would be terminated.[29] On 25 October, an auction for the replacement franchise was held; Sun TV Network won the bid for the Hyderabad franchise.[30] The team was named Sunrisers Hyderabad.[31]

Pune Warriors India withdrew from the IPL on 21 May 2013 over financial differences with the BCCI team can acquire players through the annual player auction, trading with other teams during trading windows, and signing replacements for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction[47] and set their base price and are bought by the highest-bidding franchise. Players unsold at the auction are eligible to be signed as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a player can only be traded with consent; the franchise pays any difference between the old and new contracts. If the new contract is worth more than the old one, the player and the selling franchise share the difference. There are generally three trading windows – two before the auction and one between the auction and the start of the tournament. Players cannot be traded outside the trading windows or during the tournament, whereas replacements can be signed before or during the tournament.

Some of the rules for franchises, as of the 2020 season, are:

The salary cap of the entire squad must not exceed ₹85 crore (US$11 million).[48]
Under-19 players cannot be picked unless they have previously played first-class or List A cricket.[49]
Player contracts run for one year; the franchise can extend the contract by one or two years. Since the 2014 season, player contracts have been denominated in the Indian rupee, before which the contracts were in the US dollar. Overseas players can be remunerated in the currency of the player's choice at the exchange rate on either the contract-due date or the actual payment date.[50] Before the 2014 season, Indian domestic players were not included in the player auction pool. They could be signed up by franchises at a discrete amount while a fixed sum of ₹10 lakh (US$13,000) to ₹30 lakh (US$38,000) would be deducted per signing from the franchise's salary purse. This received significant opposition from franchise owners, who complained richer franchises were "luring players with under-the-table deals." The IPL later decided to include domestic players in the player auction.[51]

The BCCI give 10% of foreign players' salary to their country's national cricket board.[52]

According to a 2015 survey by Sporting Intelligence and ESPN The Magazine, the average IPL salary when pro-rated is US$4.33 million per year, the second-highest of sports leagues in the world. Because players in the IPL are contracted only for the duration of the tournament – less than two months – the weekly IPL salaries are extrapolated pro data to obtain an average annual salary, unlike other sports leagues in which players are contracted by a single team for the entire year.[53]

According to a report by The Telegraph, IPL players are paid 18% of the revenue, which is the lowest amount compared to other major sports leagues. Most sports leagues pay the players at least 50% of the revenue. The Federation of International Cricketers' Associations said that IPL players must be paid fairly.[54][55][56]

Prize money
The 2022 season of the IPL offered total prize money of ₹46.5 crore (US$5.8 million), with the winning team netting ₹20 crore (US$2.5 million). The second-placed team received ₹13 crore (US$1.6 million), the third-placed team received ₹7 crore (US$880,000), and the fourth-placed team received ₹6.5 crore (US$810,000).[57][58] The other teams are not awarded any prize money. The IPL rules mandate half of the prize money must be distributed among the players.[59]
On 14 June 2015, it was announced two-time champions Chennai Super Kings and the inaugural season champions Rajasthan Royals would be suspended for two seasons following their role in a spot-fixing and betting scandal.[34] On 8 December 2015, following an auction, it was announced Pune and Rajkot would replace Chennai and Rajasthan for two seasons.[35] The replacement teams were Rising Pune Supergiant and Gujarat Lions.[36]

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the venue for the 2020 season was moved and games were played in the United Arab Emirates.[37][38] In August 2021, the BCCI announced two new franchises, which would be based in two of the six cities shortlisted by the BCCI – Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Cuttack, Guwahati, Ranchi and Dharamshala – would join the league starting from the 2022 season.[39][40] In closed bidding held on 25 October, RPSG Group and CVC Capital won bids for the teams. RPSG paid ₹7,000 crore (US$880 million) for Lucknow and CVC won Ahmedabad for ₹5,200 crore (US$650 million).[41][42] The teams were subsequently named Lucknow Super Giants and Gujarat Titans.

Many IPL team owners have expanded their business by buying teams in various leagues around the world, such as SA20 of South Africa, Caribbean Premier League (CPL). They branded their teams with similar names to their IPL teams.[43]
